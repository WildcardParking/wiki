# Get Started

To quickly get started with our system you need to 

1. Register on the site [wildcardparking.com](https://wildcardparking.com/user/register)
2. [Park a domain ](https://wiki.wildcardparking.com/parking-options)\(the quickest way would be [with an A record](https://wiki.wildcardparking.com/parking-options#parking-via-a-record), however [with NS records](https://wiki.wildcardparking.com/parking-options#parking-via-ns-records) may eventually be better as you will get full DNS control and DNS settings for features like email forwarding will gain automation option etc.\)
3. Done. Now you should be able to see one of our pre-installed templates on you domain and be able to play with the settings on [templates page](https://wildcardparking.com/my/templates).

For all subscription plans we provide a dedicated IP address, which easy things with parking on a step. So the following procedures may be skipped:  
On Free Account you are requested to upload your domains manually \(csv import possible\) and then the system should check and recognize them as yours, this may take up to few hours.
