## Domain details

We strive collect all important information on parked domains such as whois details, expiration/registration date. There is a separate Domains Page that will show all details in the table and you can click on the domain name from most of the pages to go to the Domain details page, where you can see provided services settings related to that domain.

## Domain unique keywords and content

This information is used by some templates that support dynamic content or SEO descriptions. For straight example this keywords are used to request related to domain name items for affiliate stores on Ebay and Amzaon. 

## Domain groups
